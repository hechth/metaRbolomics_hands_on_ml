# metaRbolomics_hands_on_ml

This is a small example for a hands-on session for machine learning on mass spectrometry data.

The goal is to develop some small scripts to predict some properties given the input dataset.
The python notebook contains some code to handle the data and transform it in a way that it is useable for a machine learning model.
